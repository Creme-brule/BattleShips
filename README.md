# BattleShips
This project was made by Yonghee, Justin, and Lewis, for a web developing class assignment. Users can create free accounts to play the game. Two players are required for playing, one must create a room and wait for a second player to log in and join said room. The game is a spinoff of the traditional battleship game, where each player tries to blinding hit the other players ship, except there is only 1 ship coordinate and one can choose to move to adjacent blocks on their turn.
